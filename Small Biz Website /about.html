                Once upon a time, a family had an idea... Good Earth Natural Foods got its start in 1973 when Rae and Ken Howard, with the help of their son Mike and Rae‘s mother, Dr. Ann Geaslin, opened a small store in Provo, Utah. By 1984, our "extra mile" service resulted in an expansion move of the original Provo store. In 1999, this store was again expanded to a new location to meet the needs of our customers. Rachel Howard Humphrey and her husband, Todd, have shared in Good Earth‘s growing vision. As General Managers and partners, they helped bring the family‘s commitment to optimum health to Midvale where a Good Earth was opened in 1989. This store was named as one of Utah‘s 100 fastest growing companies in 1996. In 1995, Todd and Rachel opened Bodymasters Nutrition, a small store located in the Salt Lake City ZCMI Mall. 1996 brought a beautiful new Good Earth to Orem. In 1998 this store was named by Health Food Business Magazine as one of the top 100 health food stores in the country.</p>
